 apps: we used React Native:
React Native builds on the HTML,CSS and Javascript 
used for the web to create modern mobile apps.

You have already learned Javascript. We will quickly learn how to use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

Using HTML and CSS, you will build a
simple portfolio page (hosted online),
where you can display all the games
you have built so far!

# html
tags : they are predefined
HTML is used to create content which is displayed on web pages.
 1) <!DOCTYPE HTML>  to tell the computer that this is going to be an HTML page. This informs the browser that it is going toread an HTML page. This is a must do for all HTML pages.

2) <head> <body>
Inside <head> tags, we store information about the page. 
Inside<body> tags we write content which isdisplayed on the web page.

3) <title>
It is displayed at the top of the browser when you open the web page. To tell the computer that it is a title, we enclose it under <title> tags.

4) <p>
to write a paragraph, we use the <p> tags.

5) <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>
<h1> tags to create a BIG header.
<h2>, <h3>, <h4> tags could be used to create SMALLER headers.

6) <a>
Our webpage needs to have some navigation menu as well which can lead to other webpages.These are called hyperlinks.

We use <a> tag to create hyperlinks.

We need to point these tags to the respective pages. This is done using 'attributes'. Each tag has some attributes.
<a> tag has an attribute called 'href'
(hypertext reference) which is used to
point the tag to other pages.


7) <img>
